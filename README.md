My Game:
This is my video game that I made in Java called sunflower quest. 

What the Project Does:
There is a little girl who jumps sround on the screen (me), that I made all the sprites for. 
This was my first time coding anything complete in Java before, I had so much fun making it, and learned a buttload of code creating it!

To download the game: Download the JAR file from Itch.io at https://reenie2010.itch.io/sunflowerquest

To run the game: The game is a Jar file, to run a Jar file you must first have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. Once installed, you can execute the file using one of two primary methods: the command line or by double-clicking.
